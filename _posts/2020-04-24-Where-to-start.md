## Where to start from?

There is plenty of material available over the net, some free and some paid. How you should be skimming through it?

* Certification paths - Go for these only if you have relevant hands on experience with Azure (3-6 months)
* Date of publication - Azure is evolving rapidly, so older the material more chances of it being obsolete

Skylines academy is offering a free [Azure fundamentals course](https://courses.skylinesacademy.com/p/azure-overview), take the benefit of the offer

The first and foremost thing, initial setup

* Create a [**trial account**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) (if not already done)
* Install AZ CLI from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
* Install [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7)
* Install Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

You can use either of AZ CLI or PowerShell based on your preference, but knowing how to combine them is important. This [blog will help](https://cloudskills.io/blog/azure-cli-powershell)

**_Note_**: PS AzureRM module is now deprecated, use command Install-Module AZ

Happy weekend. Keep learning.
