We will be splitting our journey into some milestones/learning paths, it will also help you planning for certifications later on.

* Cloud Adoption Framework
* Architecture patterns/strategies
* Identity Management & Governance
* Security
* Networking
* App/Data Migration
* Storage
* Compute

## The first steps

To make the learning a bit practical, let's assume there is a fictitious web development company WebArachnids, which provides paid hosting and responsive website templates and design services. They have an office in Australia region with ~500 employees currently. With growing business, good funding and future expansion plans they are expecting to setup offices in USA and Europe in coming years.

Till now they have been managing their application in a private datacenter in Sydney, Australia region only. Looking at the future growth plans the business have decided to relook at their current architecture and deciding to move towards cloud adoption.

But as any organization/team in this phase, they are having some valid concerns

* Customer Data Security
* High initial costs to manage both local datacenter and Cloud platform
* Availability of Skilled resources or upskilling the existing ones
* Migration Approach

We are sure that there is an opportunity and intent as well. But do you think that it is enough for a cloud migration at scale?

There are many initial milestones any organisation must achieve or invest time into before moving down the lane. Now they have an option to invest time themselves or hire any professional consultants to help them evaluating and deciding if Cloud transformation/migration is a right choice for them or not. Assuming the group decided to start exploring Microsoft Azure, what should be there first step.

This is where Microsoft's Cloud Adoption Framework comes handy, which provides guidance around best practices, tools and desired business outcomes during the adoption phase. There are few key milestones/stages defined as per the framework.

* Strategy
* Plan
* Ready
* Adopt
* Govern
* Manage

Let's quickly cover an overview of initial 2 stages

## Strategy

* Document motivations behind cloud migration
* Identify business stakeholders, document requirements and business outcomes which are easily understood by the tech teams
* Develop business case
* Identify the first pilot or **"Lighthouse project"**

There is a beautiful article written over, what a pilot project or the term we use is in our company is ["Lighthouse Project"](https://www.contino.io/insights/why-lighthouse-projects-not-powerpoints-will-unlock-your-transformation-value) helps us achieve.

## Plan

Another critical stage

* Upskilling or filling the gaps in technical/business teams
* Prepare the digital inventory (Complete list of software/hardware planned to be migrated)
* Organization re-alignment based on Cloud needs

**_Digital inventory_** will help you identify the areas where you need to _Refactor_, _Rearchitect_ or _Innovate_.
