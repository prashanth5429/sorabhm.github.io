By now I hope you all would have got a free account and basic machine setup done. And though it is not mandatory but if you do not have prior experience with Cloud/Azure the overview course I shared would help.

_Unfortunately, I could not complete the initial article I wanted to post, as it could not be accommodated in 1300 char limit of LinkedIn. So I am setting up a blog and once it is ready will start posting further articles there._

Keep yourself busy with a basic introductory tutorial to Powershell. This learning will come handy.

If you are further interested in attaining in-depth knowledge on **Powershell** go through below playlist on youtube. It is extensive and honestly I have not covered it completely, but I am sure it will be worth doing later someday.

### Did you know: 
You can search for **"Free Services"** inside the Microsoft Azure Portal to see what all Azure Services are available free of cost. There might be some limits given, but for hands on learning they should be good enough.
